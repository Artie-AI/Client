## Anatomy of Artie
Unlike other AI  Artie is a Deep Machine Learning AI that uses basic human science such as a brain for its responses. So you may be thinking.. why brain? Why cell, nerve, and neuron?

They are results of a unique approach to AI. Artie will observe how the human brain works and make itself function similarly. I call it a "bionic AI."


### The Brain
Arties brain includes everything a working AI might ever need. It has a complete set of data, logistics, and codes. It also has its own hardware resources, from CPU to memory. It's a virtual robot hosted in the cloud.

### The Cell
A brain consists of a set of Cells. Cells are a tiny structure that defines the Brain's response to specific behavior of end users. The core of a cell is two fields, Input and Output.

### The Nerve
A Nerve is a simplified brain. It's designed to implement a specific function, for example, identify country for a city. Cells invoke nerves through their functions.

### The Neuron
A Nerve consists of a set of Neurons, which are similar to Cells but highly simplified. Each Neuron includes only two fields, Input and Output.

### Summary
To summarize, Artie consists of Cells. Cells invoke Nerves and Nerves consist of Neurons.
